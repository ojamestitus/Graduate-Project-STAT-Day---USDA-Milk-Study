# STAT-Day-Project---USDA-Milk-Study

Here you will find the PDF of the poster that I presented for my Masters project. I also have attached the SAS code that was used for the statistical analysis. The project involved involved fitting a repeated measures linear mixed model to analyze the association between milk production and cow/calf performance measures for a client in Animal Science.
